monitor:
    Responsibilities:
    - mailbox hub
    - distribute mails to components
    - keep track of the current state of the whole system to send reacting messages to responsible components
    
    Behaviors:
    - wait for STIMULUS_READY_READ/WRITE from driver
    - send the received message (STIMULUS_READY_READ/WRITE) to:
        + driver
        + checker
        + scoreboard
    - wait for EXPECTED_REQUEST from checker & send to scoreboard
    - wait for EXPECTED_REPLY from scoreboard & send to checker
    - wait for DONE_CHECKING from checker & send to generator
    - repeat

    (- repeat until receiving DONE_GENERATING from the generator)

generator:
    - generate next stimulus
    - send STIMULUS_READY_READ/WRITE to monitor
    - wait for DONE_CHECKING from monitor
    - repeat until end of transaction-list

    (- send DONE_GENERATING to monitor)

driver:
    - wait for STIMULUS_READY_READ/WRITE from monitor
    - drive corresponding stimulus to DUT
    - repeat
    - (optional: check for stop executing if receive STOP from monitor)

checker:
    - wait for STIMULUS_READY_READ/WRITE from monitor
    - check on DUT for finish condition, corresponding to the type of the current transaction
    - send EXPECTED_REQUEST to scoreboard (via monitor)
    - wait for EXPECTED_REPLY from scoreboard (via monitor)
    - compare results & log
    - send DONE_CHECKING to monitor
    - repeat
    - (optional: check for stop executing if receive STOP from monitor)

scoreboard:
    - wait for STIMULUS_READY_READ/WRITE from monitor
    - record/generate/retrieve corresponding expected results
    - wait for EXPECTED_REQUEST from checker (via monitor)
    - send EXPECTED_REPLY with attached expected result back to checker (via monitor)
    - repeat
    - (optional: check for stop executing if receive STOP from monitor)

coverage:
    - wait for STIMULUS_READY_READ/WRITE from monitor
    - check on DUT for the right moments to sample for the coverage
    - repeat
    - (optional: check for stop executing if receive STOP from monitor)

**************************************************

Fix:

- DUT, slave: read the data into buffer in the state "WDATA" only. If read in state "WADDR" => the new address/data is not updated yet ==> the wrong data (wvalid is not adderted yet) or wrong address (new address is only guaranteed to be updated at the end of WADDR cycle)
